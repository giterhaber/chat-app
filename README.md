# chat-app

this was made for the purpose of no-lag issues when my friend and I are in a working collaboration. The idea came up when social medias such as facebook gives unnecessary distraction, also discord has its sets of distraction for us too. And so chat-app was born. My very first app is themed: undivided communication

> some functions may not be applicable, main purpose is for a desktop app

## EXPECTED 
- smooth app opening
- commandlines
  - `/private` opens a new chat window where a password is required
  - `/edit` opens a new window for admin tools
- draggable files
- notifaction
